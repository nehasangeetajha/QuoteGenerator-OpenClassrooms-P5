# Open Classrooms Project 5 - Quote Generator
### Hello and thanks for stopping by!

This repo contains *Open Classrooms Project 5 - Quote Generator*. The purpose of this project was to learn **JavaScript**, both syntax and creation of algorithms.

The given tasks included:

* Generate random quotes when user clicks a button
* Each quote must contain at least 3 fragments pieced together
* Quotes must still be coherent, despite being fragmented

Once this was achieved, a second version of the generator was to be made. This second version contained whole sentances on varying topics. The user can choose the topic that they wish to see a quote from, as well as the number of quotes to see at one time.
